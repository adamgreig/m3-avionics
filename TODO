m3fc config for new pyros:
    need to finish m3fc_config.py, notably __str__ for pyros class
    be nice to make a gui for this, though low priority

toad:
    use new labrador etc like m3radio
    set up nirq as sync valid, then gpio as rxclk
    record arrival time of rxclk while sync valid
    log each arrival time
    transmit average of all arrival times
    see keep

set up:
    fc cal for new fcs
    fc cfg for new fcs
    radio freqs for new radios
    program latest fw on ALL units from clean commit

test:
    imus working
    fc work with new pyro stuff
    radio/ground link working reliably with new usbserial stuff

check:
    fc mission profile stuff, just to be sure...
    procedures correct -- especially wrt battle shorts rebooting everything
