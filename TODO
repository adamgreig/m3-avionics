toad:
    use new labrador etc like m3radio
    set up nirq as sync valid, then gpio as rxclk
    record arrival time of rxclk while sync valid
    log each arrival time
    transmit average of all arrival times

m3pyro:
    resistance measurement code:
        * charge bus with cont r for fixed time, should reach 2.6V
        * measure bus voltage
        * enable a channel for fixed time (10ms?), then disable again
        * measure bus voltage
        * compute difference in bus voltage
        * report resistance responsible
    this has been prototyped but needs testing, since the pfet on resistance
    is probably very low initially and causes a rapid discharge before the
    bus voltage drops low enough to increase the pfet resistance.
    might need to just go back to previous plan.

m3radio:
    add new commands to router

set up:
    fc find cal for new fcs
    fc save cfg for new fcs
    program radio freqs for new radios
    program latest fw on ALL units from clean commit

test:
    imus working
    fc new configuration script
    fc work with new pyro stuff
    radio/ground link working reliably with new usbserial stuff

check:
    fc mission profile stuff, just to be sure...
    procedures correct -- especially wrt battle shorts rebooting everything
