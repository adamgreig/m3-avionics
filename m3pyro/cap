bus has 10k+3k3=13.3k to gnd from monitoring
continuity supply is 3v3 via 3k3 resistor

3.3V -- 3k3 R -- BUS -- 13.3k -- GND
Vbus = 3.3 * (13300 / 16600) = 2.64V

when channel asserted, additional 10k to gnd from pfet pullup
effective total resistance to gnd is 5708
Vbus = 3.3 * (5708/(5708+3300)) = 2.09V

the channel PFET has around 600R when "on", although this
depends on the voltage at the bus (of course).
should have scoped it....
as soon as the pfet turns on, Vgs is -2.6V, which is probably
enough to get usefully on. as the bus capacitor starts to drain,
Vgs will drop, and so the PFET Rds will shoot up, to around 600R.
this might happen so quickly that we can't measure anything at all?

channel provides Rch of resistance to gnd, so total is now
Reff = (Rch * 5708)/(Rch + 5708)

Bus capacitance is 22uF which is initially charged to 2.64V
we discharge it through Reff for t seconds
what is the new voltage?

something like...
I = C dV/dT
I = V/Reff
V/Reff = C dV/dT

consider: V(t) = V0 * exp(-t/(RC))
then V(10ms) = V0 * exp(-0.01/(R*22e-6))
ln(V(10ms)/V0) = -0.01/(R*22e-6)

R = -t / (C * ln(V(t)/V(0)))
